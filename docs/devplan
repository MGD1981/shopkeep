## Shopkeep Development Plan

# Main Ideas

- Player owns and operates a shop in a town in a medieval fantasy setting a la D&D.
- Shop will procure/create weapons and armor -- possibly expanding to other things in the future.
- Heroes and would-be heroes will make transactions at shop.
- Off-screen, heroes will adventure at various locations which may or may not contain treasure.  Death of a hero will add his/her inventory to that location's treasure.
- Keeping the number of transactions small will keep it manageable and keep the player interested in them.  Expanding to a megastore style will be boring without a fun management system.  Imagine throngs of villagers coming in selling their everyday garden herbs in the shop's apothecary section.
- Items will have detailed descriptions and histories of ownership, kills (or in the case of armor, notable saves-from-death), etc.
- Stats (i.e. strength, dex, etc.) do not change.  There are no experience levels.  But heroes may develop familiarity with both a specific item and also with a generic item type.
- Will start coding just weapons, leaving a framework for expansion.
- Tile-based sprites.  Will have a designer create these; will start with CP437 on my own.


# To Do

- Create CP437 sprite system (OpenGL, like Dwarf Fortress?)
- Create console-based dev menu for shop actions to act as starting point (make sure will be able to translate into a graphical system)
